# tkbackupvstsandpresets
a little tkinter utility i use to backup the vst folders on my machine and also the vital/serum/surge preset folders

step one: use the menu to set a target directory for where to put the backup

step two: use the menu to populate the list with the default paths where vsts are to be found. Alternatively, use the menu to add paths one at a time. check the boxes for surge/serum/vital presets if you also want those paths to be included.



step three: use the menu to start the backup process.  when it's done it will print copied OK to the console.
